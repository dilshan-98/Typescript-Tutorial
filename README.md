Where Typescript differs from Javascript? 

Typescript is a statically typed language which means it uses static types. This is similar to Java or C where variables, funtions,.. are explicitly assigned a type. As an example in Typescript, if you are declaring a variable "name" and assign a String value to it, you must declare the variable as a String type.



Exist in either .ts or .tsx (For JSX, React, ...)



To run without getting "\tsc.ps1 cannot be loaded because running scripts is disabled on this system", instead of "tsc", use "tsc.cmd". So, if you want index.js to run, use "tsc.cmd .\index.ts" command.
